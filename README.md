# MasterBinarySearchTree
Data Structures master binary search tree project 
This project is a program in C which builds a review-score list based on the userâ€™s reviews collected from WWW. 
These reviews are in some basic categories according to the scores they have.
This program will let the user add, remove, list the review-score list.


In the program I kept the score entries in a binary search tree by their score number. 
Then, to keep the reviews of each score, I create a binary search tree in which the reviews are kept 
by their id s (e.g., if I have five scores in your binary search tree, I will have five more binary search trees: 
one for the review list of each score.). 
I define binary search tree such that for a node, smaller valued items are kept in the left 
subtree of the node and greater or equal valued items are kept in its right subtree.

FUNCTIONALITIES

1. Add a new score node into the master-BST .  
2. Add also some reviews into a specific review-score category. 
3. Show the average score of all of the reviews. 
4. List the id s of reviews which have a particular word.
5. Remove the reviews between in a specific score-scope. 
6. Display the tree.
